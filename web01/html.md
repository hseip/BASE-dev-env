# HTML exercises

We use Google Chrome as a browser for development. If it is not already your default browser set it in the Chrome Settings.

From your home directory create a new directory named: BASE
Open VSCode
Open the BASE folder using the File menu
Click on BASE
Create a new directory named: html
Click on html
Create a new file hello.html
In the editor hit the exclamation point and hit tab. This will create a HTML skeleton
Position your cursor between the <body> tags, enter h1 and hit tab. Add Hello World between the two h1 tags.


In the bottom bar of VSCode hit Go Live. This will start the Live Server and display your Hello World page in the browser

In the editor add your name after Hello World and hit Crtl+S. This will save your changes and reload the HTML page displaying your changes.

In the Chrome browser hit Crtl+Shift+I to open the developer console. Click on Elements to see your HTML in the browser.
